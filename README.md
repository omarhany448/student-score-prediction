# student-score-prediction

This project is part of my **Elevvo Internship** where I built a **Machine Learning model** to predict students' exam scores based on multiple performance factors.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Predict students' final exam scores using study hours and other features.
- **Dataset:** Student Performance Factors (from Kaggle)
- **Techniques Used:**
  - Data Cleaning & Handling Missing Values
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Linear Regression Model
  - Polynomial Regression (Bonus)
  - Model Evaluation using R² Score & RMSE

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Study hours** and **previous scores** are the most influential features.
2. Removing outliers significantly improved the model performance.
3. Achieved **R² ≈ 0.99** with **RMSE ≈ 0.31** after cleaning the data.

## 🚀 Results
- **Linear Regression Model:**  
  - R² Score: 0.990  
  - RMSE: 0.311  

- **Polynomial Regression (Degree 2):**  
  - R² Score: 0.990  
  - RMSE: 0.322  

> Polynomial Regression did not significantly improve performance.
